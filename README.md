# Pico + RGB keypad

Using a raspberry pi pico and an RGB keypad from pimoroni to make a little macro board.

Plan is to make this actually useful for workflows, e.g. be able to automate some simple builds and stuff. 

## Windows
Currently there are three functions
0 - Launch VSCode 
1 - Launch WSL
3 - Zoom emergency exit!

## Linux
Still developing functions for this...

## Mac
Planning functions for this

## To Do list
- Make button colour correspond to function. e.g. launchers are green, emergency exits are red etc
